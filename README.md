# Advanced machine learning image segmentation with UNET
A workshop on using UNET machine learning architectures for segmentation using the Tensorflow/Keras framworks.


Outline of possible topics for the workshop

* Brief introduction to Keras
* Convolutions, skipping and max pooling
* The structure of UNET
* Metrics for measuring image/mask similarity
* Loss functions for images/masks
* Optimiser choice
* Tiling and batch sizes, memory limitations
* Data augmentation
* Image generators
* Using pre-trained encoders
* Useful methods for pre-processing
* Interactive examples: whale tail segmentation, Electron Microscopy imaging segmentation
